////////////////WORKDAY/////////////////////////

-- When they are logging in, this data where is it stored? 
* New credentials to possibly store on WDR.
* Not a straightforward credential verification.
Text link (this should be done in 5 minutes, on the phone)
WDR is for analytics.
How can we set up info through WDR?
* Might just build our own system.
-- Do we need to pipe data into WDR for analytics? What is the value of WDR? Can we not use it? 
* SOAP is bad.
* Cant get authentication.
* How important is the data and analytics.
* -- DEAD How does ICIMS integrate with everything else in accordance to login info? DEAD
* * Potentially use solar user. Create temporary users that can expire.
* * Solar users are easy and we can just push them to workday.
> MEETING Meet with Ben to make sure we can get him the info he needs.
-- How are the documents signed? Whats legal for us to do regarding signing? 
> MEETING Whats legal regarding signing? Do we need Docusign with this?

This should be a build that can grow and add additional personas and job types.


-- Docusign integrations? Do we have to go to a different site to sign everything? 
> SOLVED Plan our own
* ICIMS integrations/possible WDR integrations
* This is a potential thing to cut in first release and then integrate later

-- How are we building the MVC?
* Lauren has her own view of MVC, should we just make our own?
* Managing expectations. Is there a way to finish everything they want? Yes, is it insane? Yes.

-- What are we going to prioritize? Priority list.
* Text integration to talk about later.

-- Flowcharts for project?
> MEETING Aaron needs to get on and get access to Lucidchart
* Lucidchart



ICIMS current role is not just hire and fire of employees, they can also have prebuilt templates.
Keep icims separate from WDR and our individual systems.

If we have to, we can use their apis to make a job then call their apis to get the info to sync and make a new job.
Workday is hired individuals.

-- SVG Animation as a component? 
> SOLVED Jon would be dropping this in as a component SVG, pass in values with animations based on values.
-- How is HR creating these documents. Do we get constructed DOM of documents, just the data, a pdf?
> MEETING How does HR plan on sharing the documents?

-- How are the Victig and Tracker APIs set up? 
> SOLVED Preset up by Cameron and Jason. 

/////////////////MANAGEMENT PERSONA///////////////////////
-- When are we getting the UI mockups.

Sales manager (DM)
* List view of candidates. Different status categories, icons near with the flow. Quick visually accessible info
  send a message, time since offer sent. 
* Upper levels can see all below them inside their range of 'power'. And also see statistics and other things.
-- Is this third persona or part of the second persona. 
> SOLVED This is already in workday. We need to access this. ( ORGANIZATIONS )
> SOLVED Ask Jon for access?

Grab org information to determine view. That way Nic cant see potential hires for HR or Sales.
!-- Is this for just sales or for the whole company? How do we tuck this in? What are they using right now? Can
   implement new features for our app over a longer time period?
> SOLVED Lauren Wednesday meeting to ask.
-- If the admin is managing all the jobs out there, would it be better to actually use WDR? 
Were only building two systems, with a separate API.
 Our API will just manage data.

 ////////////////////PART 2 -- DEEP DIVE I////////////////////////
 * WILL EVENTUALLY NEED ACCESS TO AWS
 This is currently stored in elastic beanstalk.
 Cloudfront?
 Cloudfront/S3/
// Webhooks
HR
Ask for jenkins to pull in on okta dashboard.  
> Talk to somebody in devops support to get permissions.

-- Can we map out architecture in the docs?
> SOLVED Jon is okay jumping into it.
> SOLVED Process and systems flow chart will be contstructed by Aaron.
> SOLVED Include a runbook that displays steps on how to solve problems encountered.

 -- What is the JSON object that we have on AWS???

 -- Where in S3 are our buckets?


////////////////////KEY POINTS//////////////////////////////

* What are they using right now?
* Can we implement new features over a longer time period? YES
* Will we still use tracker? Otherwise it has to go.

* UI mocks?

* Number of personas?

* Where are our S3 buckets?


  
/////////////////////DEEP DIVE PART I-PART II/////////////////

CloudFront and AWS (S3 with a pipe to CloudFront)
Five minute pushes.


WDR is for corporate and install personas, job requisitions.

Still need to build a process chart. Sales manager process creates job and the offers via hr they 
dont want to use wdr the normal process for coroporate and for installers they first create posistion in 
workday and then create the job in wdr. Then they use hotrod for document signing and prehire processing.
 And all the data is copied back to workday.

 Were building two systems.

 We need a data layer that stores all the data and interacts with hotrod.

> Cant we just use hotrod instead of WDR?

> Do we need to interact with the offer docs?

NO Do they sign the offer on our app?

> Can we simplify offers? Can we create a unique offer system?

> Do we pipe information over to WDR for analytics?

> Recruiting and onboarding in one place?

> POST requests?

>>> Cancel requests?

> Have to see who admin is logging in as. Ping WD.


Admin UI is kinda blurry. 

Admin logs into HR API which checks Workday for who they are in charge of. Admin can also send offers ( sales ).

> Where will we store our docs? ElasticSearch will store all the stuff.

>>>> Where is sensitive info stored? Are they just signing docs?

SCRUM


-- How are the documents signed? Whats legal for us to do regarding signing?
> SOLVED Plan our own

* UI mocks?



>>>> Do candidates fill in personal information in our app? "We know that sales candidates will fill in personal 
info. Will corporate installs fill in their information? Where do those candidates start in our app? What has 
already been completed in our app?"

!> All personal information will be in WD for install/coroporate.

-- Not all tasks will be available for all people. 

> Legal and signature?

> Frank should have in the next few weeks of the finalized view of the skeleton.

>>>>Just corporate, installs, sales?

>> Corporate has 200 different postions.
>> This is going to be based on state with positions.

Potentially a third persona. Could be tucked inside admin view. This is tucked inside only sales. Have the 
ability to step in as overlord use (masquerade) permissions from others. This is still in the dark. We're not
fully certain whats going to be here.  

!> Thats it, no more roles. 

!> Ability to implement more roles?
